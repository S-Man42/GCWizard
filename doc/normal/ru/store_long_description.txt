The GC Wizard is an open-source tool collection.

It was originally created to offer Geocachers as an offline tool to support them with in-field mysteries and riddles. So, the GC Wizard contains numerous tools for simple cryptography, geographic and scientific calculations as well as hundreds of sets of various symbols.

Meanwhile the project became very huge and might be practicable for many non-Geocaching issues.
